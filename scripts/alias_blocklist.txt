# Alias Blocklist
#
# This file contains aliases that should NOT be automatically added to tags.
# Common reasons for blocklisting:
# - Too generic (e.g., "test", "data", "web")
# - Ambiguous across multiple libraries
# - Single letters (too short)
# - Common words that aren't specific to the library
