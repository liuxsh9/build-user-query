# IAA Annotation Template
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Instructions for annotators:
#
# 1. Read docs/annotation_guidelines.md BEFORE starting.
# 2. For each sample, fill in all 9 categories independently.
# 3. Multi-select categories: provide a list of tag IDs (e.g., [python, javascript]).
#    If no tag applies, use an empty list [].
# 4. Single-select categories: provide exactly one tag ID.
# 5. Do NOT look at other annotators' results.
# 6. If unsure, see the annotation guidelines' boundary cases section.
#
# Valid tag IDs for each category — see taxonomy/tags/*.yaml for full list.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

annotator_id: ""       # Fill in: A1, A2, or A3
