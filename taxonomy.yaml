# Capability Taxonomy Schema
# Version: 1.0
#
# This file defines the structure of the capability taxonomy used for
# labeling SFT training data. The taxonomy consists of 8 orthogonal
# categories, each containing tags that describe specific capabilities.
#
# Tag Schema:
#   id: string           # Unique identifier (kebab-case)
#   name: string         # Display name
#   category: string     # Category this tag belongs to
#   subcategory: string? # Subcategory (for hierarchical categories)
#   description: string? # Brief description
#   aliases: string[]?   # Alternative names for matching
#   language_scope: string[]? # Applicable languages (for Concept tags)
#   difficulty: enum?    # basic | intermediate | advanced (for Concept tags)
#   examples: string[]?  # Example query snippets
#   related_tags: string[]? # Related tag IDs
#   granularity: enum?   # library | module | component (for Library tags)
#   paradigm: string[]?  # Programming paradigms (for Language tags)
#                        #   Values: imperative, functional, object-oriented, declarative,
#                        #           logic, procedural, concurrent, event-driven
#   typing: string?      # Type system (for Language tags)
#                        #   Values: static, dynamic, gradual, duck, strong-static, weak-dynamic
#   runtime: string?     # Execution model (for Language tags)
#                        #   Values: compiled, interpreted, jit, transpiled, hybrid
#   use_cases: string[]? # Primary use cases (for Language tags)
#                        #   Values: web, systems, data-science, mobile, embedded, scripting,
#                        #           devops, scientific, game-dev, blockchain, markup, config, build
