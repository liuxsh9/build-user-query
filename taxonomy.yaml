# Capability Taxonomy Schema
# Version: 1.0
#
# This file defines the structure of the capability taxonomy used for
# labeling SFT training data. The taxonomy consists of 8 orthogonal
# categories, each containing tags that describe specific capabilities.
#
# Tag Schema:
#   id: string           # Unique identifier (kebab-case)
#   name: string         # Display name
#   category: string     # Category this tag belongs to
#   subcategory: string? # Subcategory (for hierarchical categories)
#   description: string? # Brief description
#   aliases: string[]?   # Alternative names for matching
#   language_scope: string[]? # Applicable languages (for Concept tags)
#   difficulty: enum?    # basic | intermediate | advanced
#   examples: string[]?  # Example query snippets
#   related_tags: string[]? # Related tag IDs
#   granularity: enum?   # library | module | component (for Library tags)
